# Project

## Project rules:
- Choose and share your idea with the teachers before 01.11
- You are working on the project until the end of the course
- You can work in groups (you should tell us that you are working in a group)
- Try to use what we learnt during the course
- You can use something that was not covered during the course
- You can (but don't have to) use one of our ideas

## Project ideas
### Text analysis
#### Description:
A user can enter a text using the console. The application should calculate a statistics and show it to the user:

- amount of the sentences
- amount of the words
- the longest word
- the longest sentence
- top 5 the most popular words in the text 
#### Bonus:
If you finished the exercise, here some ideas how you can make it more complex and use something else:

- Read a text from a file
- Application receives a path to a folder, checks all files in this folder and create a statistics as a json file for 
each file + a statistics for the folder, that contains: 
    - How many files were processed
    - The biggest text
    - The smallest text
    - The longest sentence
    - The longest word
    - The top 5 the most popular words across all the texts
- Add tests for your application

#### You will use from the course:
- OOP
- Data Structures 
- Tests
- File IO

#### You will need to learn yourself:
- String operations

### Phone Index
#### Description:
A user can enter a text using the console. Which contains phone number and name and they should be able to 
- save number
- add new numbers later
- search for contact by name or phone number

#### Bonus:
If you finished the exercise, here some ideas how you can make it more complex and use something else:

- user can search for number and delete it from phone index

#### You will use from the course:
- OOP
- Data Structures 
- Tests
- File IO

#### You will need to learn yourself:
- String operations
