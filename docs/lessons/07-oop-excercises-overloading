## Exercises (review of previous ones)
 
### Exercise 1
Create 2 robots named Rob and Bot. Rob is yellow and Bot is blue. Rob weights 10kg while Bot just 8kg. Rob has green eyes and Bot has black eyes. Each of the robots should print their attributes when asked to introduce themselves. Create a class that has all the attributes that Rob and Bot have and a method called introduce() that will let the robots tell us all their characteristics, then create Rob and Bot and ask them to introduce themselves. To be able to create Rob and Bot, add to the Robot class a constructor that has all the attributes the robots need.
Example: My name is Rob. I weight 10kg. I have green eyes

### Exercise 2
Add different types of constructors for the Robot class:
 - Default constructor
 - Constructor with 1 parameter - the name
 - Constructor with 2 parameters - the name and eye color. 
 Create different robots using all the constructors and let them introduce themselves. 
 Observe what will be the values of the attributes when using different constructors.

### Exercise 3
You work for DHL and you have to drive a truck full of packets. Design the Truck into a java class then create the truck. Add specific truck attributes to the Truck class.

### Exercise 4
You need to load your truck with packets. Design the Packet class. The packet should know the details of the sender and be able to print them. Add 3 packets to your truck and print where you need to deliver them.
